    "8. If the last characters of str1 and str2 are different: Recursively call the editDistance procedure with the updated parameters: Keep str1 unchanged and reduce the length of str2 by 1 (m, n-1) to consider the insertion operation, Reduce the length of str1 by 1 and keep str2 unchanged (m-1, n) to consider the removal operation. Reduce the length of both strings (m-1, n-1) to consider the replacement operation.\n",
